# Discord Faucets

The Espresso Systems Discord Faucet is a general purpose faucet service for testnet EVM blockchains.
It is a standalone microservice that can be deployed for any EVM chain, pointed at a funded account,
and immediately start serving requests. A Discord bot can be connected to the faucet service so that
users can request funds simply by writing their address in a Discord channel.
